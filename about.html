    <p>
        Traditional cloud deployments often rely on virtual machines
        with manual configurations and stored credentials, which can
        lead to security risks and operational issues.
    </p>

    <p>
        This project addresses these challenges by using Docker
        containers for application isolation and AWS IAM Roles
        for secure authentication without storing access keys.
    </p>

    <p>
        The website is first developed locally and then securely
        deployed on AWS EC2 using Docker, following best practices
        in cloud security and DevOps.
    </p>

    <h3>Project Goals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Improve security using IAM roles</li>
        <li>Ensure application isolation using Docker</li>
        <li>Reduce deployment errors</li>
        <li>Demonstrate secure cloud architecture</li>
    </ul>
